Summary: Generates navigation bread crumbs in WordPress. Requires permalinks.

== Description ==

Simple Crumbs Redux is a resurrection of the Simple Crumbs plugin by Can Koluman (http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-crumbs/) 0.2.5 codebase. Version 1.0.0 of Simple Crumbs Redux fixes a fatal error generated when using PHP 5.4 and greater (and a deprecation warning with PHP 5.3). I'm keeping the original short code (though you can also use [simple_crumbs_redux]) so this plugin will work as a drop in replacement for Simple Crumbs.

Simple Crumbs Redux - Generates a breadcrumb trail for pages and blog entries. Requires use of permalinks and PHP >= 4.1.0. Tested up to WordPress 4.2.2 and PHP 5.5.

**Notes:** link/crumb information from $query_string, page/post information from $post, using permalink info for making links, using permalink structure for bootstrapping unrolled recursions (deepest to topmost).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why another breadcrumbs plugin? =

A client of mine was using the Simple Crumbs and it wouldn't work once PHP was updated on his server. As Simple Crumbs hadn't been updated since 2009 and I needed to get my client going, I just created Simple Crumbs Redux and got him going. I made a few minor improvements over the original plugin and will work as a drop in replacement. Whether I add any other features depends on my needs and if I get any requests from users.
